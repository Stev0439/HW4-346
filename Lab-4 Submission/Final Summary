This project was fine. I was able to accomplish the assigned tasks. 
Most of the mistakes came from not understanding where to put specific text in the js files in relation to other 
parts of the code. However, most of these were realitvely easy to solve, especially with the help of my teammates. 
Nothing special to mention.
