My submission includes all the files provided by the class along with my edits to the files. However, I only uploaded the 'open' files of a limited number of things primarily the server and test folder as well as the miscellaneious files not included in folders. The other files that were included are held in a zip file because I tried transferring all the files over in the exact same folders they were originally in, however github will not recognize .git as a folder name. So I included all of those files in the zip package, this might be the most useful in assessing my code if all the other files are useful and should be paid more attention than the other 'open' files. That is it.
